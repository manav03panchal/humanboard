How about this? have a toggle button on the bottom to HIDE THE CANVAS ITSELF? the infinite scrollable canvas is hidden (handle the webviews and shit too) and make this thing function like a full blown text editor too. This would mean sidebar (examples in gpui component) floating movable, splittable tabs of the files) a terminal.

The Canvas is updated live as well with files being added and shit but gives the user a visual aid on how to do things...

the code files preview's dont go away when asset is removed from canvas.
like markdown files and pdfs do...

fucking cmd+k and esc dont work... for command palette.

WE COULD ADD A CLAUDE WEBVIEW! (but how handle auth?)

Webview not supported on Linux build...

Need to accomodate ctrl instead of cmd too.

Search bar overlaps over font selection when in theme....


need tabs drag and droppable... 
mutli windows..
better context and state management.
