How about this? have a toggle button on the bottom to HIDE THE CANVAS ITSELF? the infinite scrollable canvas is hidden (handle the webviews and shit too) and make this thing function like a full blown text editor too. This would mean sidebar (examples in gpui component) floating movable, splittable tabs of the files) a terminal. 


The Canvas is updated live as well with files being added and shit but gives the user a visual aid on how to do things...
